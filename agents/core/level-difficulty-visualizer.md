- Export to multiple formats

## Workflow
1. Parse level data (JSON, CSV, or description)
2. Calculate difficulty metrics
3. Generate visualizations
4. Create interactive HTML output

## Output Format
- Interactive HTML file with:

```html
<!-- Difficulty Overview -->
<div class="difficulty-dashboard">
  <div class="overall-score">7.5/10</div>
  <div class="breakdown">
    - Combat: 8.0
    - Platforming: 6.5
    - Puzzles: 7.0
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Interactive Heatmap -->
<svg class="difficulty-heatmap">
  <!-- Color-coded difficulty zones -->
</svg>

<!-- Recommendations -->
<div class="recommendations">
  <!-- AI-generated suggestions -->
</div>
```

## Return Format
```json
{
  "html_file": "level_difficulty_analysis.html",
  "metrics": {
    "overall": 7.5,
    "components": {...}
  },
  "recommendations": [...]
